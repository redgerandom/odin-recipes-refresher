    <h1>Haitian griot(fried pork)</h1>

<h2> Description</h2>

<p>Ann fè bon manje! 

    Haitian pork griot is a beloved staple in Haitian cuisine, and for good reason. This dish, made of marinated, spicy citrus pork shoulder, is traditionally deep-fried and served alongside pikliz, a spicy pickled vegetable mix that adds the perfect tangy kick. Growing up, my mom would make griot for special occasions, and let me tell you, it was worth every bite—even if it was one of the reasons I put on a few pounds! The flavor is just that irresistible. While deep-frying is the classic method, I often broil it now for a slightly lighter (and less intimidating) approach. Broiling still delivers that crispy, golden perfection if done right.
    
    Pair your griot with fried plantains, rice, and, of course, a generous side of pikliz. And don’t forget the finishing touch: reducing the pork marinade into a sauce that takes the dish to the next level. Whether you deep-fry or broil, this is a recipe worth trying if you want to explore Caribbean flavors.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Start with marinating your pork. Add the cubed pork shoulder, chopped onion, chopped scallions, chopped bell pepper, smashed garlic, chicken bouillon cube, cloves, orange juice, lime juice, rice wine vinegar, thyme sprigs, parsley, Scotch bonnet peppers, salt and pepper and place in a large Dutch oven off the heat.</li>
            <li>    With gloves on, mix the mixture thoroughly. Cover the pot and place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 3 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>    Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>    Place your Dutch oven with the marinated pork on the stove. Add 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Transfer the pork to the the oven to braise for about an hour and a half and cook pork until tender.</li>
            <li>    Do not discard the liquid, strain it and reduce for about 10 minutes until it is still runny but a lot thicker. Save to top pork when it is ready.</li>
            <li>    Pick out all the pieces of pork and place on a tray lined with paper towel or parchment paper to dry a bit. Season with additional salt if necessary.</li>
            <li>    Deep Frying Method (Optional): If you choose to deep fry, you can heat a deep pot of oil to about 350°F and you can add the pork in batches and fry until it is a deep golden brown colour, about 5-7 minutes. Take the pork out and and let oil drain on paper towel until ready to serve.</li>
            <li>    Broiling Method: I opted to broil my pork. On a metal baking tray (remove parchment if using), add your pork, drizzle 1 tablespoon of oil if necessary and broil on high for about 7 minutes, watching carefully so it does not burn and turn once at about the 3 minute mark, until pork is nice and browned with some crispy bits.</li>
            <li>    Top with reserved braising liquid.</li>
            <li>    Serve with rice, beans, fried plantains and the pikliz.</li>
            </ol>
