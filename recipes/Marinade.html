<h2> Description</h2>

<p>Ann fè bon manje! 

    Haitian Marinade is a beloved street food and snack in Haitian cuisine. These crispy, deep-fried fritters are made from a seasoned batter of flour, water, and aromatic spices, often with the addition of fresh herbs like parsley and thyme. Marinades are versatile and sometimes include vegetables, fish, or meat. They are golden and crunchy on the outside while soft and flavorful inside, making them an irresistible treat perfect for gatherings or as an appetizer.
